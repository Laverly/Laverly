I've never been great with introductions...

I'm Laverly, and this GitHub repository is my space for practicing Git and various development tasks. My primary focus is on security research, but I'm putting in the effort to become a competent developer as well.

Most of my security expertise lies in web security. However, my knowledge of web development is a bit lacking. I find coding desktop applications more comfortable. My aim is to bridge this gap and enhance my skills, enabling me to become a proficient web security researcher.

In addition to my coding practice, I'm studying math and logic. These subjects, along with computer science, have always been of interest to me. It's only recently I have the resources to learn the proper foundations.

On a personal note, I have an interest in video game development, although I won't be sharing much about it here.

I don't know how many people will actually view this, given this repository is mostly for practice, but welcome anyway.
